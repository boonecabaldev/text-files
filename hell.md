# In Hell, Nobody Can Hear You Scream


Living with a severe and rare form of dissociative amnesia has profoundly impacted my life, creating a disability that prevents me from sustaining employment. The resulting lack of steady income has led to significant hardship. Adding to these challenges, I have no contact with any living family members and face an overwhelming amount of student loan debt that feels insurmountable. My specific type of dissociative amnesia is difficult to diagnose and even more challenging to treat.  
   I have experienced homelessness twice and sought help in emergency rooms numerous times due to suicidal ideation. My persistent dissociations have led to termination from every job I have ever held. Consequently, I have spent a significant portion of my life in isolation, poverty, and feeling like an outcast.  
Furthermore, I have ADHD, which initially required stimulant medication. However, I developed a tolerance and subsequent addiction, a struggle that significantly disrupted my life for a decade. I struggle with self-regulation and self-control to such an extent that I require external limitations to function effectively.  
   My dissociative episodes occur with high frequency, between 1,500 and 3,000 times daily, leaving me in a constant state of confusion and anxiety. This condition also affects my ability to manage belongings. In the past five months alone, I have lost nine USB-C cables, a phone battery charger, two bags of groceries, one phone, and ten gloves, one at a time. In the past month, I've noticed the emergence of depersonalization symptoms. I feel a distinct lack of personal agency, as if my actions are driven by an external force, leaving me merely an observer.  
   Given my history, I anticipate being fired from my next job. The pattern seems inevitable: my unusual demeanor will likely cause friction with colleagues. Someone may try to take advantage of me, and my confrontation will be viewed negatively. I will likely forget to clock in, misremember tasks, and misunderstand directions. Eventually, these issues will culminate in my termination. I also live with the constant awareness that any possession of value I have with me—be it my wallet, backpack, phone, or even a glove—could simply disappear at any moment due to my dissociative amnesia.  
   Beyond the personal consequences of these dissociations, I also face potential trouble for involuntary actions I might take while dissociated. Attempts to explain my condition are often met with disbelief, leading to accusations of laziness, dishonesty, or manipulation.  
   Currently, I am on parole, and a key condition is achieving financial stability. However, my disabling condition makes holding a job impossible. Adult Probation and Parole will only recognize my disability upon the approval of a Social Security disability claim. Until then, I remain vulnerable.  
   I have applied for disability insurance twice and been denied both times. My third application is pending, but I fear it will either be denied as well or take longer than I have. To avoid homelessness and a parole violation that could result in a year of imprisonment, I must remain in Fortitude, which provides a crucial safety net. If my current disability claim is denied, I am deeply concerned that I may lose my will to live.  
   To reiterate, I find myself in an untenable position. I am unable to meet the requirements of my parole, yet my disabling condition is not recognized. This forces me into a cycle of seeking employment, fully aware that I will inevitably be terminated, a process that inflicts profound emotional distress, potentially to the point of suicide. This reality seems to be of no concern to those overseeing my parole.  
   The recent emergence of impaired willpower feels like the breaking point. If I lose control of my own actions, I will have truly lost everything. This appears to be my current state. My mind now feels distinctly divided: an observing self (which I identify as "me") and an acting entity. I can consciously decide on actions I want and need to take, choosing to pursue them, but it is this other force—the "actor"—that seems to control my body and execute those (or other) actions. I am no longer in control.  
   The pervasive and involuntary nature of my dissociations explains the myriad difficulties I face, and tragically, they remain untreatable. It is my belief that dissociative disorders may be more prevalent than currently understood. Their very disabling nature can prevent individuals from accessing the treatment they need. If one is unable to consistently attend appointments, effective treatment becomes impossible. I have been actively seeking treatment for my dissociations since 1999 without success. In fact, it wasn't until 2022 that the focus shifted to my awareness rather than my memory. The only intervention that offered any relief was meditation, but I discontinued it due to a perceived lack of time.  
   The central issue I need to emphasize is what my team and I have identified as "Micro dissociations," or MDs. These are involuntary and random episodes where my conscious awareness shuts off, and my mind enters a daydream-like state. Following an MD, when my awareness returns, I experience a period of being dazed and confused, without a clear recollection of what I was just doing. Through self-experimentation, I've determined that these MDs occur approximately every 15 seconds, totaling between 1,500 and 3,000 such episodes daily.  
   Throughout my life, well-meaning individuals have suggested various reminders as a solution. However, this approach fundamentally misunderstands the nature of my condition. If an alarm goes off, and I become briefly aware, only to dissociate again a second later and then return with no memory of the alarm or my momentary awareness, a reminder system cannot function. If such systems were effective, I would not suffer from dissociative micro amnesia. Please take a moment to fully grasp this.  
   An experience from 2002, while living in San Diego, illustrates this point. My roommate was concerned about leaving the apartment door unlocked at night. Despite my best intentions, I repeatedly failed to remember to lock it. In response, she placed numerous signs throughout the apartment. Over several weeks, I never consciously registered seeing a single one. Each time I should have seen a sign, I was lost in an MD. This ultimately led to her asking me to move out.  
   Similarly, in 2015, while working at a resort cleaning apartments, an incident occurred involving a four-wheeler and a parked BMW SUV. I looked behind me, saw the SUV, turned forward, put the four-wheeler in reverse, and backed into the vehicle, causing $1,500 in damages. Again, it is crucial to understand that these constant, unpredictable disruptions negate any solution that relies on my sustained awareness or ability to remember to perform an action.  
   These frequent MDs have significant social consequences. Witnessing someone constantly freeze, appear confused and dazed, and repeatedly forget everything is highly unusual. This is further complicated by the fact that I can often speak articulately and intelligently, creating a dissonance that makes it difficult for others to believe these are genuine symptoms of a mental health disorder. As a result, I have been laughed at, ostracized, harassed, and even bullied. This constant social friction generates significant anxiety, compounding my pre-existing social anxiety disorder, which makes me prone to severe anxiety attacks in social settings.  
   My only desire at work is to perform my duties without drawing attention, but my MDs make this impossible. They are too frequent and too noticeable to ignore, and they often elicit ridicule or exploitation. This has driven me to a life of profound isolation, which is as detrimental to one's health as smoking. One direct consequence of this isolation is that I have only had five romantic relationships in my entire life. Against my own deep desires, I have relinquished the hope of finding a woman who could love me. This has caused me irreparable emotional harm. Every new group of people I encounter is perceived as a potential source of harm, where derision, harassment, and exploitation are inevitable.  
   Hopefully, you can now understand how these MDs have cost me every job I have ever held. Despite taking five years to earn a degree in software engineering, my career lasted only 14 months. Since then, I have lost every job, become estranged from all living relatives, have virtually no friends, and have been denied SSI benefits twice. The inability to earn money has a devastating impact on every facet of life, a concept that is truly difficult to fully grasp unless experienced. I have only begun to touch upon the multitude of problems that plague me constantly.  
   I have not detailed my addiction to ADHD stimulant medication, the trauma of a failed year in the Marine Corps, or the intense rage, hate, and contempt I have developed for how I have been treated throughout my life. My two applications for Social Security disability were denied, primarily because my degree was interpreted as proof of competence for even basic employment. The last Administrative Law Judge stated he was not convinced of my disability, suggesting that if I could put a ball in a box, I must be capable of working. I tried to explain that my job losses are not due to an inability to perform simple tasks, but rather due to getting lost, forgetting to clock in, and a pervasive inability to understand or remember instructions.  
   Following the second denial, in a state of despair and intoxication, I attempted suicide with my mother's shotgun. Out of shame, I will not elaborate on the details of my failed attempt, but it resulted in charges of attempted aggravated kidnapping and a 43-month prison sentence. I was also placed on the sex offender registry for ten years. Due to time constraints, I am omitting a vast amount of crucial detail.  
Fast forward to my parole: I worked at a call center for four months before being fired. The primary reasons were the stress I caused management by constantly forgetting to clock in and being a persistent problem due to my absentmindedness and apparent memory issues. While unemployed, I accepted that conventional employment was unsustainable and attempted to earn income through entrepreneurship. I pursued video production, website development, and Amazon FBA private labeling, all of which failed. The failure of the Amazon FBA venture led to homelessness.  
   I was unable to remain in the homeless shelter because I consistently forgot to report to the storage container holding my belongings. Failure to do so resulted in the destruction of my property. First, a backpack containing all my electronics was destroyed, followed by a duffel bag with all my clothing, forcing me to beg for clothes from a former landlord. Finally, my CPAP machine was destroyed. The immense stress led to arguments with the shelter staff, and I was ultimately asked to leave. My psychopathic former landlord allowed me to live in a filthy storage shed without running water. During this time, I developed software for him using Python, receiving occasional payments of $20-$40. I had to perform favors for a psychopathic acquaintance for access to a shower once or twice a week. My ex-landlord noticed my poor hygiene but offered no solutions, instead treating me with disdain.  
   While living in the shed, I texted my parole officer repeatedly over six weeks without a response. One day, he found me on the street and arrested me for not contacting him by visiting his office. This resulted in another five months in prison, where I received no meaningful help, had half my medication discontinued, and was denied a CPAP machine. I was also sexually assaulted by a guard.  
   Upon my release on parole, my ex-landlord immediately removed me from the halfway house and moved me between three different apartments to conceal this from the property owner. Before my previous incarceration, he had promised a project that would lead to employment. After completing the work, I was again violated and sent back to prison for not wearing an ankle monitor that I was not even supposed to have. This resulted in an additional eight-month prison sentence, during which I was assaulted by another inmate for refusing to give him all of my medication daily.  
   After my release, I discovered that my ex-landlord had either lost or stolen my laptop and cell phone, locking me out of my Google account, which contained my YouTube channel with 100 videos and 12 years' worth of saved documents. Throughout my time on parole, I consistently read books, studied new technologies, and attempted to start businesses. I even received a $3,000 grant, which I used for my failed Amazon FBA endeavor. The stress during these periods was so severe that I admitted myself to the emergency room at McKay-Dee Hospital seven times. The last time I attempted to admit myself, my anxiety and agitation were so extreme that they refused to take me.  
   I am currently on my third parole and residing at the Fortitude halfway house. For five months, I unsuccessfully tried to establish a career or side income writing software development articles. I wrote five high-quality articles and submitted them to numerous websites, only to be accepted by one, which then rejected my work claiming they already had articles on the same topics (which they did not). I have been at Fortitude for a year, and I know that if I save enough money and leave, I will become homeless and subsequently be sent back to prison for a year. I am certain that I will die before I return to prison. The streets here are saturated with fentanyl, and if I become homeless again, I honestly don't know what I will do. This disability claim is the only thing that can save my life. I have spent the past year in constant agony over the potential loss of this claim and the terrible fate that awaits me. For the last two months, I have experienced almost continuous episodes of intense, crippling depression.  
   My primary fear has been that if I were to abscond and attempt suicide, I might fail and be sent back to prison before I could die. I am utterly alone in this nightmare.  
   I have no reason to believe that my situation will ever improve. My depression is so profound that I feel a complete loss of willpower. I consistently make self-destructive decisions, fully aware of the consequences but unable to stop myself. My acute depression compels me to break down and weep almost daily, sometimes in public. I don't know how much longer I can endure this. 
   The only explanation that makes sense to me is that I am living in some form of karmic hell, paying for terrible actions from a past life. All of this trauma has broken me. The fact is I died a long time ago, when I lost my software career.
