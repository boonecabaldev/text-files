When I was growing up I had a best friend named Donald who was a little bit on the slow side, but I liked him nevertheless. Unfortunately, me and some of my other friends took to abusing him because it was easy. He didn't retaliate. We thought it was funny to slap him in the face. 
One time in high school I tried to shoot him in the leg with a homemade blowgun dart it had an actual wire nail tip. I missed.

Me and my brother used to prank call his parents and then record the conversations. Then I would take my tape recorder to school and play it to my friends who thought it was hilarious. During one phone call Donald made the terrible mistake of singing a ridiculous sounding song, which obviously we recorded. We were pretty young at this time, I think in the 6th or 7th grade.

When we were seniors in high school, I had a friend named Kevin who is senior project was broadcasting a small 2-minute video to the entire school every morning. I thought it would be funny to play the audio clip of Donald singing the ridiculous song in the background of one of these broadcasts. Somehow, Donald found out or suspected something was going to happen, and right before the morning broadcast started it was dead silent in the classroom. When the broadcast started and Donald started singing everyone burst out laughing except for Donald.

Donald has made no effort to reach out to me since high school, even though we were best friends starting in the first grade. As I think back about all of this horrible s*** that I did to him, I feel so much guilt, and I know I can never undo this. I'm sure that he will suffer with all of these horrible memories until the day he dies, and it's all because of me and my cruelty.

i had another friend named gerald. he was a very obese boy. i felt bad for him because he was an outcast like donald. we spent a lot of time together growing up. unlike with donald, i didn't pick on gerald. we had one or two problems, but beyond that, we got along. until high school.
(continued 1/3)
i had a popular native american friend named brandon. gerald and brandon never got along. one day in high school they had a disagreement. well, gerald told me some stuff about brandon, and then i told brandon what he said. then brandon told me to give gerald a message, which was a threat basically. when  told gerald the threat, he basically said he could beat brandon up.
(continued 2/3)
after school brandon and about ten other preppies intercepted gerald when he left school and was walking home. brandon busted gerald in the mouth, and gerald went running back into the building. like a little bitch. ever since this, gerald blames me and has never forgiven me.

About My Sexuality
i hated women from almost the moment i was born. my narcissistic, selfish mother abused me physically and verbally. she was truly a hateful woman. this was the first woman in my life. then, i had a disgusting shithead of a female babysitter--donald's mom. she was a gross, fat, idiot who could never stop yelling, bitching, and swearing. she wore on me. i got her back though; i recorded her temper tantrums and played them to my friends at school.
(continuing)
from that point forward, i seemed to just hate girls and women for no apparent reason. in the first grade while i was at skate land, a little mexican girl--that i had actually previously had a crush on--and i had an "argument". it wasnt really an argument; it's how girls flirt, i just didnt know it. anyway, about 10 minutes after that argument, she returned and asked me to skate with her on the couple's skate. enraged, i said, "fuck no i dont want to fucking skate with you! are you stupid?" i was furious at her inconsistent behavior (i didnt know she was flirting earlier)
(continuing)
even as i write this, i can feel the mysogynistic hate inside of me. if someone asked me to tell them why i hated women, i wouldnt have been able to give a good answer. i found them extremely irritating--their nature, the fact that i was so attracted to them. that hate is a monster inside of me, and it made me pay an entire lifetime of a sexless, loveless life. it hasnt been until about the past year that i have begun renouncing this hatred. but it's still inside of me. it makes me weep when i think about it.
