When I was growing up I had a best friend named Donald who was a little bit on the slow side, but I liked him nevertheless. Unfortunately, me and some of my other friends took to abusing him because it was easy. He didn't retaliate. We thought it was funny to slap him in the face. 
   One time in high school I tried to shoot him in the leg with a homemade blowgun dart it had an actual wire nail tip. I missed.

   Me and my brother used to prank call his parents and then record the conversations. Then I would take my tape recorder to school and play it to my friends who thought it was hilarious. During one phone call Donald made the terrible mistake of singing a ridiculous sounding song, which obviously we recorded. We were pretty young at this time, I think in the 6th or 7th grade.

   When we were seniors in high school, I had a friend named Kevin who is senior project was broadcasting a small 2-minute video to the entire school every morning. I thought it would be funny to play the audio clip of Donald singing the ridiculous song in the background of one of these broadcasts. Somehow, Donald found out or suspected something was going to happen, and right before the morning broadcast started it was dead silent in the classroom. When the broadcast started and Donald started singing everyone burst out laughing except for Donald.

   Donald has made no effort to reach out to me since high school, even though we were best friends starting in the first grade. As I think back about all of this horrible s*** that I did to him, I feel so much guilt, and I know I can never undo this. I'm sure that he will suffer with all of these horrible memories until the day he dies, and it's all because of me and my cruelty.
