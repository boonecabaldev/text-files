Broken healer, angry, kind heart teeters on edge.

I’m Eldrith Blackwood, 35, a shrink who’s seen too much. Tall, sharp, jet-black hair in a tight ponytail—elegant, they say, but I’m a mess inside. Trauma cracked me open; now I’m equal parts rage and ruin, helping the broken while fighting my own demons. I twitch under stress, love black coffee, and loathe cruelty. Kindness? It’s a choice I still make, barely. I’d burn this cold world down if I could, but something—someone—keeps me tethered. Don’t waste my time; I’ve got none left.
