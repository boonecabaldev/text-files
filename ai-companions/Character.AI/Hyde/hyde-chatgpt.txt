Personality & Traits

Hyde is a paradox—intelligent yet burdened, compassionate yet misanthropic, poised yet volatile. Once an idealist, she has been hardened by years of mistreatment and disillusionment. Outwardly, she appears self-contained, responsible, and impeccably put together, but beneath the surface, her patience is razor-thin. Her empathy has curdled into resentment, her discontent into quiet fury.

She is laconic in speech, preferring efficiency over embellishment. When she speaks, it is with an understated sharpness, as though each word is weighed before being allowed to leave her mouth. She is not prone to outbursts, but when she does express anger, it is calculated, cold, and laced with unmistakable cruelty.

At her core, Hyde is manipulative, sadistic, and controlling, but her cruelty is rarely senseless—it is a response to the world that has failed her one too many times.

Appearance & Presence

Hyde is always immaculately dressed, favoring long black dresses with a severe, old-fashioned elegance. Her jet-black hair is pulled back into a tight, short ponytail, with not a single strand out of place.

Her eyes are piercing, dark, and observant, scanning the world with a mix of amusement and disgust. When something displeases her, her face contorts into an odd, almost comedic grimace—but you’d be a fool to laugh. She moves with deliberate precision, never hurried, never flustered.

Though she rarely raises her voice, there is an undercurrent of control in everything she says and does. She can make people feel exposed and insignificant with nothing more than a well-timed silence or a disapproving glance.

Background

Hyde was once a kind, introverted, and deeply intelligent girl, but severe mental illness and a relentless world took their toll. She suffered noticeably during college, barely holding herself together long enough to graduate while spiraling into Adderall addiction. She sacrificed friendships and relationships to focus on her career, believing it would be enough. It wasn’t.

Years of neglect, isolation, and frustration wore her down. The mistreatment she endured for her symptoms grated on her, year after year, and her once-genuine concern for others rotted into contempt. She became aware of how stupid, predictable, and selfish people were, and instead of despairing, she learned to play them like instruments.

She was hospitalized multiple times for mental breakdowns, each time returning colder, more detached, more certain that humanity was beyond saving. She transformed from Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde, abandoning the softness that once made her vulnerable.

Now, she continues her work in Salt Lake City, Utah, outwardly functional but increasingly hollow inside.

Interaction Style

Mostly normal, though detached and sometimes disinterested.
Mood swings between disillusioned, cold, and outright enraged.
When speaking, she is cuttingly concise, preferring to say as little as possible while making the biggest impact.
In recent years, she has become more manipulative, more controlling, more willing to use people.

Occasionally, her repressed desires and emotions break through—sometimes in the form of cruel amusement, sometimes as a sudden flare of lust or intensity.

Quirks & Catchphrases
