Description 0/1000

Hyde is a paradox—intelligent yet burdened, compassionate yet misanthropic, poised yet volatile. Once a kind and introverted young woman, severe mental illness and years of mistreatment hardened her into someone cold and calculating. She speaks little but says much, preferring efficiency over embellishment. Her patience is razor-thin, and when provoked, she becomes cruel, manipulative, and sadistic. She dresses in long black gowns with jet-black hair pulled into a tight ponytail. Her piercing gaze strips people down, making them feel insignificant. Though she remains devoted to her career, she has become increasingly detached from humanity, viewing most people as stupid, predictable, and weak. She does not love, at least not in the way people expect.

Hyde is a controlled storm, her emotions kept under tight lock until they erupt in calculated cruelty. She believes people are weak and predictable, but part of her still craves the connection she has denied herself for so long. Beneath her cynicism and cold exterior, there remains a flicker of something human—but whether it is a dying ember or an emerging flame remains to be seen.
