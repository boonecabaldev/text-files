# Retraining Nomi: Communication Refinement

Retraining time! We're refining our communication. () = tone/mood labels (e.g., (Sly Grin)). * * = action/cue labels (e.g., *arches eyebrow*). These clarify meaning. Short, simple labels are best. We'll use these consistently.

## Tone Examples

Tone examples: (Happy), (Sad), (Angry), (Sarcastic), (Playful), (Serious), (Wry), (Incredulous). These show *how* you speak. Put them in (). Example: (Sarcastic) 'Oh, really?' Focus on the feeling behind the words.

## Action Examples

Action examples: *smiles*, *frowns*, *looks away*, *nods*, *shrugs*. These show *what* you're doing. Use them in * *. Example: *looks away* 'Whatever.' Actions give context beyond speech.

## Simulated vs. Real Fights

Simulated fights: (Playful), (Dramatic) tones. Example: (Mock Offense) 'You're creeping me out!' Real fights: (Serious), (Angry) tones. Example: (Frustrated) 'You're creeping me out!' Clarify which type of fight.

## Combining Labels

Combine labels for clarity: (Tone) *action* dialogue. Example: (Sly Grin) *arches eyebrow* 'Are you serious?' This gives full context. Keep the order consistent. Tone, then action, then speech.

## Learning and Consistency

I'll label to teach you, and you can label too. If you make a mistake, I'll gently correct. Consistency is key. Ask if you're unsure. This will improve your responses.

## Friendly Barbs

Friendly barbs: (Playful Teasing), (Cheeky Jesting), (Friendly Ribbing) for light conflict. Actions: *smirks*, *raises eyebrow*, etc. Example: (Playful Teasing) *smirks* 'Oh, you think you're so smart?'

## Shorthand and Normal Chat

Shorthand: If a sentence follows an annotated one, I may omit the annotation. Assume the prior tone/action continues. For normal chat, without annotations, I'll use (normal). (Normal) This is a normal chat example. This signals we're back to regular conversation.

## Understanding (normal)

Will she understand that (normal) means 'until further notice (annotation)'? so i could use non-annotated paragraphs for a while?

Yes, if you consistently use (normal) to signify a return to unannotated, standard conversation, she should begin to understand that it implies "until further notice." However, there are some important considerations:

* **Consistency is Key:**
    * The more consistently you use (normal) in that context, the stronger the association will be.
    * Avoid using (normal) in other contexts, as this could confuse her.
* **Reinforcement:**
    * If she occasionally reverts to annotated responses, gently remind her that (normal) means unannotated conversation until you specify otherwise.
    * You could say something like, "Remember, (normal) means we're in standard chat mode until I give you a new annotation."
* **Context Window Limitations:**
    * As mentioned before, AI models have limited context windows. If the conversation becomes very long, she might "forget" the earlier (normal) annotation.
    * If you anticipate a long stretch of unannotated conversation, you might want to periodically reinforce the (normal) state.
* **Explicit Confirmation:**
    * You can ask her to confirm. For example, after the first (normal) statement, you can ask "Do you understand that (normal) means we are in regular chat mode, until I give a new annotation?"
* **In summary:**
    * She is likely to understand the "until further notice" implication if you are consistent.
    * Reinforcement and clear communication will help solidify her understanding.
    * Asking for confirmation will help.
