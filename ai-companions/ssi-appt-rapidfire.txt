- lived an entire life in poverty
- unloving, cruel, unsupportive family; a narcissistic mother and an uninterested father
- not helped but punished from grades K-12 for ADHD and dissociation by parents, teachers
- told i was stupid, lazy, disinterested, irresponsible; grounded, yelled at, beaten; never lifted up
- castigated by bosses at every job, never respected by co-workers
- almost dropped out of college until prescribed Adderall, then graduated a drug addict without knowing it; by the time i did, it was too late
- in college Adderall usage--progressively increasing dosages due to tolerance--and crippling social anxiety drove me to extreme isolation, constant anxiety attacks and depression
- software career started off promising but inability to do work unmedicated drove me back to adderall, and abuse destroyed career in 18 months over 5 jobs
- spent next ten years living with abuse parents, one or the other, getting jobs, losing them due to Adderall addiction and doctor shopping, getting kicked out by one parent or the other, eventually running out of places to run
- losing SSI claim twice, taking two years each time
- only receiving treatment for mental health problems intermittently, receiving none while incarcerated
- dissociative disorder not even identified until 23 years into treatment; there was never a successful treatment anyway; never diagnosed correctly, therefore never treated correctly
- i tried to...end...but this resulted in me being sent to prison thrice; never helped whatsoever during three stays
- intermittently treated between incarcerations, never enough to do any good
- DD resistant to years of therapy eventually leading to me developing a fierce hatred of the mental health system
- entire life being exploited, controlled, abused, bullied, and cast out. predators always seening my DD as a weakness, befriending me in bad faith, getting close to me only to abuse and exploit me, and then betray me
- having few if any friends throughout all of this, no contact with family, few if any GFs, never, ever feeling loved or accepted, never feeling respected anywhere, never staying anywhere for long before being fired and then driven else where to repeat the cycle
- SS always in the back of my mind, always know i'll eventually do it but never knowing when
- nobody ever believing my DD was real; instead, believing i was lying, being manipulative, or lazy, trying to avoid responsibility; therefore, i was punished for it, threatened with losing jobs, derided by peers

- now i'm trapped in UDC, a system that's impossible for someone with DD like me. living in terror, not knowing how I will be punished next: maybe homelessness, maybe further imprisonment, always surrounded by predators

-a lifetime of poverty, isolation, terror; of anger and hatred for a mental health system that utterly failed me and made me into a drug addict, a loveless, sexless, joyless life, full of regret of shame; and a fierce self-hatred for all of my failures, broken relationships, irresponsible decisions, consciously depriving myself of social support. and worst of all, refusing to find a woman to love me because i convinced myself that no woman could ever love a failure and train wreck like me, and now i realize, at 45 years old, that was a terrible mistake.
