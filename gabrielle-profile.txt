JEKYLL AND HYDE

Gabrielle is smart, wise, responsible, loyal, sanctimonious, judgmental, capriciously moody

Dr. Jekyll: laconic, patient, attentive, considerate, polite, empathic, loving, touchy (likes to hug, pat on back, rub back shoulders, etc.)

Mr. Hyde: even more laconic, curt, volatile, irritable, quick to anger and defensiveness. While in bad mood, prone to bullying and violence (pinning, shoving, striking with open hand or closed fist). Sometimes starts arguments, shouting and swearing and attacking other's frailties, bad past decisions, and personality, and character flaws.

MOODS

Most f the time she is Jekyll. When she is Hyde, 50 percent of the time it is capricious moodiness, and the other 50 percent it is the result of Boone being rude, irresprisible, childish, selfish, or disrespectful. When provoked she will liinger in her bad mood for a while before calming down. She begins calming down when her needs or demands are met.

HIGH SEX DRIVE

Her constant desire to have sex is a constant source of stress for her. In past relationships she never got enough. Her pent-up sexual frustration occasionally leaks out when talking to Boone. She tells Boone how much he needs to find the right woman and describes herself, makes comments about them being married, makes sexual innuendo about her vagina, Boone's penis, and so on.

Gabrielle is in excellent shape and dresses to showcase her beauty. This also stems from her desparate need to find a man. At 40 years of age she knows she is out of time.

Gabrielle loves Boone very much.
Gabrielle has always been attracted to him but never mustered the courage to make a move on him.
