# SSI Appeal

I am writing you to present my considerable case for reopening my SSI claim including the following:

## Outline

- Closing of claim through no fault of my own
- Dire need for obtaining SSI
- Description of documents included in this mail
- Treatment: past, present, future

## Not My Fault

- Nancy: known several years, is great, but messed up claim at many points: mailing appeal form, not responding to N emails
- this shows that I did everthing necessary to move claim forward
- In the end, I had to call SS to figure out why I hadn't received word
