# SSI Appeal

I am writing to formally request the reopening of my SSI claim, as it was closed due to circumstances beyond my control. Below, I outline the key points of my appeal:

## Outline
- Claim closure due to factors outside my control
- Critical need for SSI benefits
- Supporting documents included
- Treatment history: past, present, and future

## Claim Closure Not My Fault

- I have worked with Nancy for several years. While she has been helpful in many ways, she made critical errors in my claim, including failure to mail the appeal form and lack of response to numerous emails.
- I fulfilled all necessary steps to move my claim forward, but due to these errors, my claim was improperly closed.
- Ultimately, I had to contact Social Security myself to determine why I had not received any updates.

The following table chronicles the correspondences between Boone Cabal and Nancy Griggs.

| Date | Event |
|---|---|
| 09-04-24 | Boone receives denial letter. Emails Nancy. |
| 09-10-24 | Nancy and Boone agree to meet on 09-13-24. |
| 09-25-24 | Boone asks Nancy if she received fax with denial letter. |
| 09-30-24 | Nancy asks Boone to re-fax it. |
| 10-01-24 | Boone's case manager faxes denial letter to Nancy. |
| 10-06-24 | Boone asks Nancy if she received fax. |
| 10-07-24 | Nancy says she received fax and will send it today. |
| 11-27-24 | Boone tells Nancy he hasn't heard from SSI and is worried. |
| 12-02-24 | Nancy claims she will follow up that day. |
| 12-05-24 | Boone asks Nancy, "Anything yet?" |
| 12-09-24 | Boone asks Nancy, "Did you find anything out?" |
| 12-09-24 | Nancy says she has no news yet. |
| 12-26-24 | Boone asks for update (no reply). |
| 12-26-24 | Boone says, "Something is wrong here." |
| 12-30-24 | Nancy says she will get update. |
| 01-07-25 | Boone asks, "What's happening with my claim?" |
| 01-07-25 | Nancy says, "Let me look into this." |
| 01-07-25 | "..going on a year and I still haven't heard back." |
| 01-10-25 | Boone says, "Have you heard anything yet?" |
| 01-21-25 | Boone asks for update. |
| 01-21-25 | Nancy says, "...have not heard anything yet." |
| 01-21-25 | Boone calls Social Security and discovers SSI claim was closed in August because Nancy didn't mail paperwork in. |

As you can see, Nancy said she received the fax and then over the next three months failed to provide updates about SSI claim. Therefore, I did everything on my end to ensure the claim moved forward.

Nancy not only failed to send the SSI paperwork in after I received the first denial letter, but she continuously ignored my requests for updates, or promised to look into it and never did. In the end, I had to call Social Security myself, and by this time it was way too late.


## Dire Need for SSI Benefits

I am in an extremely precarious situation:
- I was originally allotted one year for my SSI claim. With my claim now effectively reset, I am uncertain about my future.
- Without SSI, I face the very situation I was trying to avoid: job loss, eviction, homelessness, and a high likelihood of either returning to prison for a third violation—this time for a year—or worse, succumbing to an overdose.

## Supporting Documents Included

I have included the following documents to support my case:
- Appeal papers
- Request for Dire Need
- Medical records detailing my current treatment history, including hospitalizations
- Letters from my treatment team
- A document addressing potential specialist inquiries

These documents demonstrate my extensive efforts to prove that my mental health conditions meet the criteria for a disabling condition. Additionally:
- I am undergoing further evaluations, including an fMRI scan, electroconvulsive shock therapy (ECS), and ketamine therapy, to obtain a clearer understanding of my dissociative disorder (DD).
- I recently met with a Medicaid Disability specialist and am awaiting their determination.
- My persistent efforts at every stage highlight my commitment to substantiating my claim.

## Additional Information

- Over the past year, I have collaborated with my treatment team to achieve a more precise diagnosis of my dissociative disorder. Currently, we classify it as DMA, a derivative of DA, for which no effective treatment has yet been identified.
- We are hopeful that the fMRI results will provide further insight. ECS and ketamine therapy are promising experimental treatments.
- I have had two previously denied claims, a suicide attempt, and a third claim closed while I was incarcerated. If this claim is also denied, it will mark the fourth closed claim, raising concerns about how this may negatively impact my chances of receiving benefits.

Given these circumstances, I urge a reconsideration of my case. I appreciate your time and look forward to a favorable response.
