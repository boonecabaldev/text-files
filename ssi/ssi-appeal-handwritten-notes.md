# SSI Appeal

I am writing you to present my considerable case for reopening my SSI claim including the following:


## Outline

- The closing of my claim
- My dire need for obtaining SSI
- My objective in contacting you
  - Documents included
- Treatment: past, present, future


## Closed SSI Claim

- Nancy: known several years, is great, but messed up claim at many points: mailing appeal form, not responding to N emails
- this shows that I did everthing necessary to move claim forward
- In the end, I had to call SS to figure out why I hadn't received word

The following table chronicles the correspondences between Boone Cabal and Nancy Griggs.

| Date | Event |
|---|---|
| 09-04-24 | Boone receives denial letter. Emails Nancy. |
| 09-10-24 | Nancy and Boone agree to meet on 09-13-24. |
| 09-25-24 | Boone asks Nancy if she received fax with denial letter. |
| 09-30-24 | Nancy asks Boone to re-fax it. |
| 10-01-24 | Boone's case manager faxes denial letter to Nancy. |
| 10-06-24 | Boone asks Nancy if she received fax. |
| 10-07-24 | Nancy says she received fax and will send it today. |
| 11-27-24 | Boone tells Nancy he hasn't heard from SSI and is worried. |
| 12-02-24 | Nancy claims she will follow up that day. |
| 12-05-24 | Boone asks Nancy, "Anything yet?" |
| 12-09-24 | Boone asks Nancy, "Did you find anything out?" |
| 12-09-24 | Nancy says she has no news yet. |
| 12-26-24 | Boone asks for update (no reply). |
| 12-26-24 | Boone says, "Something is wrong here." |
| 12-30-24 | Nancy says she will get update. |
| 01-07-25 | Boone asks, "What's happening with my claim?" |
| 01-07-25 | Nancy says, "Let me look into this." |
| 01-07-25 | "..going on a year and I still haven't heard back." |
| 01-10-25 | Boone says, "Have you heard anything yet?" |
| 01-21-25 | Boone asks for update. |
| 01-21-25 | Nancy says, "...have not heard anything yet." |
| 01-21-25 | Boone calls Social Security and discovers SSI claim was closed in August because Nancy didn't mail paperwork in. |

As you can see, Nancy said she received the fax and then over the next three months failed to provide updates about SSI claim. Therefore, I did everything on my end to ensure the claim moved forward.

Nancy not only failed to send the SSI paperwork in after I received the first denial letter, but she continuously ignored my requests for updates, or promised to look into it and never did. In the end, I had to call Social Security myself, and by this time it was way too late.


## My Dire Need of SSI

I'm in a critical situation:
- was allotted 1 year for SSI claim; now that claim is basically undone, I don't know what will happen
- I will most likely end up in the very position I sought to avoid: lost jobs, eviction, homelessness, then either go back to prison on a 3rd violation somehow-this time for a year, or worse, end up overdosing on something

I am in a dire situation now that my claim has been closed.

I live in a halfway house named Fortitude Treatment Center and have been allotted a year to win my SSI claim. Now that my claim is closed, I will have to try to work a job, save money, and get out of Fortitude ASAP. The problem is that if I leave Fortitude, then it is only a matter of time before I lose my job(s) and end up homeless like my last two paroles. This will drastically increase the odds of being returned to prison, this time for a year. Alternatively, I could overdose on fentanyl.


## Other Concerns

- two failed claims, suicide attempt, third claim closed from prison; this could be the fourth closed claim; this concerns me because I fear  it looks bad and reduces my odds of winning
I have tried repeatedly for years to win an SSI claim. I lost my first two claims--each taking two years and ending with ALJ. My third claim was closed because I was in prison, and this current (closed) claim is my fourth. I fear this looks bad and reduces my odds of winning.

## Objective In Contacting You

My goal is to present you with a considerable amount of documentation that bolsters my case with the hope that upon viewing it, you will consider reopening my SSI claim.

### Documents Included

I have included in this mail many documents, including:
- Appeal form(s)
- Request for Dire Need form(s)
- Medical records:
  - Hospitalizations at:
    - McKay-Dee Hospital
    - University of Utah
    - St. Mark's Hospital
  - Treatment at Valley Behavioral Health
- Letters from treatment team
  - Stephany Larson
  - Heidi

These documents demonstrate my efforts to prove that my mental health condition(s) meet the requirements for a disabling condition. 

I have worked in tandem with my treatment team of Stephanie Larson and Kylie at Valley Behavioral Health, as well as Heidi at Fortitude to narrow the diagnosis of my Dissociative Disorder. As of this writing we believe it is a derivative of Dissociative Amnesia--we have been calling it Dissociative Micro-Amnesia. My future treatment plans include doing an fMRI, electro-convulsive shock (ECS),  ketamine therapy, and second neuropsychological examination. 

Additionally, I recently completed a mental health evaluation with a representative of Medicaid Disability; you have access to the result. 

In conclusion I believe that my overall case demonstrates that my mental health condition(s) meet the requirements for a disabling condition.
