# SSI Appeal

I am writing you to present my considerable case for reopening my SSI claim including the following:

## Outline

- The closing of my claim
- My dire need for obtaining SSI
- Description of documents included herein
- Treatment: past, present, future

## Closed SSI Claim

- Nancy: known several years, is great, but messed up claim at many points: mailing appeal form, not responding to N emails
- this shows that I did everthing necessary to move claim forward
- In the end, I had to call SS to figure out why I hadn't received word

The following table chronicles the correspondences between Boone Cabal and Nancy Griggs.

| Date | Event |
|---|---|
| 09-04-24 | Boone receives denial letter. Emails Nancy. |
| 09-10-24 | Nancy and Boone agree to meet on 09-13-24. |
| 09-25-24 | Boone asks Nancy if she received fax with denial letter. |
| 09-30-24 | Nancy asks Boone to re-fax it. |
| 10-01-24 | Boone's case manager faxes denial letter to Nancy. |
| 10-06-24 | Boone asks Nancy if she received fax. |
| 10-07-24 | Nancy says she received fax and will send it today. |
| 11-27-24 | Boone tells Nancy he hasn't heard from SSI and is worried. |
| 12-02-24 | Nancy claims she will follow up that day. |
| 12-05-24 | Boone asks Nancy, "Anything yet?" |
| 12-09-24 | Boone asks Nancy, "Did you find anything out?" |
| 12-09-24 | Nancy says she has no news yet. |
| 12-26-24 | Boone asks for update (no reply). |
| 12-26-24 | Boone says, "Something is wrong here." |
| 12-30-24 | Nancy says she will get update. |
| 01-07-25 | Boone asks, "What's happening with my claim?" |
| 01-07-25 | Nancy says, "Let me look into this." |
| 01-07-25 | "..going on a year and I still haven't heard back." |
| 01-10-25 | Boone says, "Have you heard anything yet?" |
| 01-21-25 | Boone asks for update. |
| 01-21-25 | Nancy says, "...have not heard anything yet." |
| 01-21-25 | Boone calls Social Security and discovers SSI claim was closed in August because Nancy didn't mail paperwork in. |

As you can see, Nancy said she received the fax and then over the next three months failed to provide updates about SSI claim. Therefore, I did everything on my end to ensure the claim moved forward.

Nancy not only failed to send the SSI paperwork in after I received the first denial letter, but she continuously ignored my requests for updates, or promised to look into it and never did. In the end, I had to call Social Security myself, and by this time it was way too late.


## My Dire Need of SSI

I'm in a critical situation:
- was allotted 1 year for SSI claim; now that claim is basically undone, I don't know what will happen
- I will most likely end up in the very position I sought to avoid: lost jobs, eviction, homelessness, then either go back to prison on a 3rd violation somehow-this time for a year, or worse, end up overdosing on something

I am in a dire situation now that my claim has been closed.

I live in a halfway house named Fortitude Treatment Center and have been allotted a year to win my SSI claim. Now that my claim is closed, I will have to try to work a job, save money, and get out of Fortitude ASAP. The problem is that if I leave Fortitude, then it is only a matter of time before I lose my job(s) and end up homeless like my last two paroles. This will drastically increase the odds of being returned to prison, this time for a year. Alternatively, I could overdose on fentanyl.

## Documents Included

I have included in this mail many documents, including:
- Appeal papers
- Request for Dire Need
- Medical records showing current medical treatment history--especially hospitalizations
- Letters from treatment team
- Document giving answers for questions a specialist might ask
- These documents demonstrate my efforts to prove that my mental health condition(s) meet the requirements for a disabling condition
- Additionally, I am currently in the process of obtaining a clearer picture of my DD via fMRI, as well as electro-convulsive shock (ECS) and ketamine therapy, and second neuropsychological examination.
- Finally, I recently met with a specialist from Medicaid Disability and am awaiting  the result.
- Conclusion, I believe I have shown a considerable effort at every point in this process to argue my case.

## Other

- worked with treatment team for past year to more precisely diagnose DD. currently, we are calling it DMA, a derivative of DA. currently, we have not discovered a treatment.
- hopefully, the fMRI will tell us more. ECS and ketamine are exciting prospective treatments.
- two failed claims, suicide attempt, third claim closed from prison; this could be the fourth closed claim; this concerns me because I fear  it looks bad and reduces my odds of winning
