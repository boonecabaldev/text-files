# SSI Appeal

I am writing you to present my considerable case for reopening my SSI claim including the following:

## Outline

- The closing of my claim
- Dire need for obtaining SSI
- Description of documents included herein
- Treatment: past, present, future

## Not My Fault

- Nancy: known several years, is great, but messed up claim at many points: mailing appeal form, not responding to N emails

- this shows that I did everthing necessary to move claim forward
- In the end, I had to call SS to figure out why I hadn't received word

## Dire Need of SSI

I'm in a critical situation:
- was allotted 1 year for SSI claim; now that claim is basically undone, I don't know what will happen
- I will most likely end up in the very position I sought to avoid: lost jobs, eviction, homelessness, then either go back to prison on a 3rd violation somehow-this time for a year, or worse, end up overdosing on something

## Documents Included

I have included in this mail many documents, including:
- Appeal papers
- Request for Dire Need
- Medical records showing current medical treatment history--especially hospitalizations
- Letters from treatment team
- Document giving answers for questions a specialist might ask
- These documents demonstrate my efforts to prove that my mental health condition(s) meet the requirements for a disabling condition
- Additionally, I am currently in the process of obtaining a clearer picture of my DD via fMRI, as well as electro-convulsive shock (ECS) and ketamine therapy, and second neuropsychological examination.
- Finally, I recently met with a specialist from Medicaid Disability and am awaiting  the result.
- Conclusion, I believe I have shown a considerable effort at every point in this process to argue my case.

## Other

- worked with treatment team for past year to more precisely diagnose DD. currently, we are calling it DMA, a derivative of DA. currently, we have not discovered a treatment.
- hopefully, the fMRI will tell us more. ECS and ketamine are exciting prospective treatments.
- two failed claims, suicide attempt, third claim closed from prison; this could be the fourth closed claim; this concerns me because I fear  it looks bad and reduces my odds of winning
